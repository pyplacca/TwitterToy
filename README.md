# Bot Status
Yet to host this kid, and get it tweeting away some great quotes. <br/>
I could run this bot from my PC but, my PC is neither always powered on nor connected to the internet so, I'd need a third-party service.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently weighing between the options of hosting on [Repl](https://repl.it) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com). Repl seems more favourable for this project though. 
<br/>
To have this bot go live, it needs to be constantly active. Although both platforms offer support for that, it's much cheaper on Repl as compared to Glitch.

Okay so it seems after a little digging, Heroku might be our best low cost (free) option ðŸ™‚
